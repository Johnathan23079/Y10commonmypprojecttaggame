<!--Two player tag game to promote communication-->
<!--Features-->
<!--1. Players can move around the screen using the arrow keys and the wasd keys-->
<!--2. Players can tag each other and the tagger wins if the players intersect-->
<!--3. The runner wins if the tagger does not tag the runner within 800 ticks-->
<!--4. The game keeps track of the tagger wins and the runner wins-->

<p>PRESS CRTL+R TO START</p>
<p>This is a two player game, red is the runner and uses the arrow keys for movment, blue is the tagger and uses the awsd keys for movement, the goal is for red to evade the blue tagger chasing, every 5 seconds avoided the runner gains 1 point</p>
